## Frontend Development

* [ ] HTML: Structure of the To-Do List page is finished.
* [ ] CSS: Styling of the To-Do List is complete.
* [ ] JavaScript: The To-Do List is fully functional, allowing tasks to be added, marked as completed, and more.

## Transition to Backend

* [ ] With a fully functional and styled frontend, it's time to transition to Python on the backend.
* [ ] Set up Python using a web framework like Flask or Django if not done already.
* [ ] Begin by creating Python functions and routes to handle tasks such as saving and retrieving data (tasks) from a database.

## Backend Integration

* [ ] Integrate the frontend and backend by allowing JavaScript in the frontend to make AJAX requests or use the fetch API to communicate with the Python backend.
* [ ] Data, such as new tasks, is sent from the frontend to the backend for storage.
* [ ] Data is retrieved from the backend to populate the frontend, such as fetching existing tasks from a database.

## Additional Backend Features

* [ ] User authentication
* [ ] Task due dates
* [ ] Task categories.
